# CRDDSProject
This repository was created to house information related to Matt Jungclaus's final project from the data bootcamp put on by the University of Colorado Boulder's Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship Data Bootcamp. The files herein will be a collection of data files found across the web, information about how Matt combined these files, and a series of scripts analyzing these files. 

The Jupyter Notebook file (CRDDS_Jungclaus.ipynb) contains the majority of the relevant information for this project. It starts with the written portions of the project, goes on to perform an anlaysis on a dataset, and then includes a few key takeaways from Matt's point of view.
